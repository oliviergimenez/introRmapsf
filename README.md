# Introduction to GIS and mapping in R using the `sf` package

In this repo, you will find the slides of my introduction to GIS and mapping in R using the `sf` package. The presentation is available [here](https://oliviergimenez.github.io/intro_spatialR/).

To reproduce the slides, you may clone or download the repo, then just open the Rmd file and Knit it :smiley: 

Alternatively, you might want to use the code from [a standard R script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oliviergimenez/intro_spatialR/master/index.R).

The data are mostly big shapefiles that you can download directly from [here](https://mycore.core-cloud.net/index.php/s/4xknhWGhp2PqRsJ). Unzip the file, and put everything in a shp/ directory. You're ready to go. 

The first version of the slides was released on Feb 8, 2019, amended on Oct 30, 2020 (structuration in directories, cleaning, use of DT and mapview packages), and updated on May 13, 2022.
